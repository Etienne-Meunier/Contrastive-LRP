# Contrastive_LRP

This is a pytorch implemention of the following work Contrastive layerwise relevance propagation (CLRP):

Understanding Individual Decisions of CNNs via Contrastive Backpropagation
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02100.pdf

The code creates CLRP saliency maps to explain individual classification on VGG16 model.

Version: numpy 1.14.2; python 3.6.4; pytorch 0.4.0 (should be compatible with a higher version);
